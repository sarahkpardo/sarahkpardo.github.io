On the interpretability of models
======

I think of it as consisting of two components:

### _A priori_: The model architecture is interpretable.
In evaluating _a priori_ interpretability, we can ask:
 - can each component of a model be put in correspondence with an existing 
   formal concept?
 - is there a good formal justification for each model component?

_A priori_ interpretability is linked to inductive bias built in to choices of 
model. If we choose an inductive bias which corresponds well to the problem, 
we are establishing _a priori_ interpretability.
    
### _A posteriori_: The output of a fitted model is interpretable.
In evaluating _a posteriori_ interpretability, we can ask:
 - is there a reasonable correspondence between a change in the model 
   input and change in output?
