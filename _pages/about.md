<!--- The quickest ways to know about me are through my [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/sarahkpardo/items/KD7YLV6A/item-list), sorted by "date added," and some generations I made with [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/sc/RT6MUL6KeUCZSat2AQXU0ZJT). --->

A theorem on machine learning: 

> **_A model, when built out of data created and labeled by people, is no less than a mirror which reflects back to us our patterns._**

A corollary:

> **_The output of a model trained on human behavior is a completion of the statement_**
> 
>       If you continue to do things as you have done them before, here is what you would do next:

<!---A theorem on human nature, as such:
> **_Noise is a matter of opinion on what the signal is._**--->

Proofs with and without words are forthcoming.
