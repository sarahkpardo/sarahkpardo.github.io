The quickest ways to know about me are through my [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/sarahkpardo/items/KD7YLV6A/item-list), sorted by "date added," and some generations I made with [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/sc/RT6MUL6KeUCZSat2AQXU0ZJT). 
<!--- I was totally floored by the beauty of [this](https://labs.openai.com/s/n6ebRMT5wb57CxkkVWXR34Vu) in particular. On the other hand, [this one](https://labs.openai.com/s/bIrjunDp6u0riN4xcfy15Oa6) is rather concerning. --->

Here is one of the conjectures I have derived from these collections: 

> **_A model, when built out of data created and labeled by people, is no less than a mirror which reflects back to us our patterns._**

Proofs with and without words are forthcoming.

I have been thinking a lot lately about ReLU, i.e. the ramp function $R(x) = \max\\{0, x\\},$ for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that it satisfies the differential equation

$$
\frac{d^{2}x}{dx^{2}}R(x - x_{0}) = \delta(x - x_{0}),
$$

which means that it is a Green's function for the second derivative operator. 
 , and as such, for any function $f(x)$ with an integrable second derivative $f^{\prime\prime}$, 

$$
f(x) = f(a) + (x - a)f^{\prime}(a) + \int_{a}^{b}R(x - s)f^{\prime\prime}(s)ds, \quad a < x < b.
$$


Expanded thoughts on the significance of this are also under construction.
