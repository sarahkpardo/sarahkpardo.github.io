The quickest ways to know about me are through my [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/sarahkpardo/items/KD7YLV6A/item-list), sorted by "date added," and some generations I made with [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/sc/RT6MUL6KeUCZSat2AQXU0ZJT). 
<!--- I was totally floored by the beauty of [this](https://labs.openai.com/s/n6ebRMT5wb57CxkkVWXR34Vu) in particular. On the other hand, [this one](https://labs.openai.com/s/bIrjunDp6u0riN4xcfy15Oa6) is rather concerning. --->

Here is one of the conjectures I have derived from these collections: 

> **_A model, when built out of data created and labeled by people, is no less than a mirror which reflects back to us our patterns._**

Proofs with and without words are forthcoming.
